# About me

<br/>

Hello.  If you're here, it means you've stumbled down the corner of the internet where I store my data science projects.  Make of that what you will.

My name is Scott Onestak.  I currently reside in Pittsburgh, PA, working as a data scientist.  Previously, I attended the University of Rochester, majoring in both Data Science and Economics.

I'm fascinated most by understanding human behavior.  What makes people tick?  My projects span US elections, finance, and the housing market to name a few.  I absolutely love Survivor.  (If you're reading this, hit me up Jeff Probst.)

Overall, this is a place to explore questions I want to answer and work to expand my skillset as a data scientist.  If you explore the site, I hope you can learn something you didn't know before or at least walk away questioning a different perspective.  If you have any questions or want to get in touch, some of my social media accounts are in the footer below.

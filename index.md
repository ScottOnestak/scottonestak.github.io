[2022 House Forecast](https://scottonestak.github.io/Projects/2022_House_Forecast/2022_House_Forecast.html)

Build a forecasting model to predict the results of the 2022 Midterm Election for the United State House of Representatives using variables such as polling, previous election results, financials, demographics from the census, and shapefiles.

[Pittsburgh Neighborhood Zillow Tracker](https://scottonestak.github.io/Projects/Pittsburgh_Zillow_Tracker/Pittsburgh_Zillow_Tracker.html)

Scraping Zillow's data for sold houses, I used this information to examine patterns as well as construct a gradient boosting machine that can be used to predict a house's current sales value as well as view the effects of the most important features in the model.  Some of these most important variables include suburb, living area, and bathrooms.

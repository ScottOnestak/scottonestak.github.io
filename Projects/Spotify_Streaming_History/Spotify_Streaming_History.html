      <p>If you're asking if I had the foresight to begin tracking my Spotify streaming history using last.fm in 2015 so that one day I could analyze myself, the answer is yes.  And, today is that day.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Using my listening history, I pulled atributes from <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features">Spotify's Audio Features</a> to get song attributes, such as danceability, tempo, energy, and valence.  I then used these features to construct Principal Compenents, with which I clustered the songs into 8 unique clusters.  Below are the results.</p>

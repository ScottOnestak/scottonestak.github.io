## Welcome to my GitHub Projects

Below is a list of all my GitHub projects on the site.

<br/>

[The Economy](https://scottonestak.github.io/Projects/The_Economy/The_Economy.html)

Using FRED data, try to understand the workings of the macroeconomy better through projects such as recession prediction.  This is an ongoing project.

<br/>

[2022 House Forecast](https://scottonestak.github.io/Projects/2022_House_Forecast/2022_House_Forecast.html)

Build a forecasting model to predict the results of the 2022 Midterm Election for the United State House of Representatives using variables such as polling, previous election results, financials, demographics from the census, and shapefiles.  This isn't just an improvement on the 2018 House Forecast; it's a whole new model.

<br/>

[Spotify Streaming History](https://scottonestak.github.io/Projects/Spotify_Streaming_History/Spotify_Streaming_History.html)

Having been tracking my Spotify streaming data since October 2015, I use Spotify's Audio features to cluster songs I've listened to and view any patterns or changes in my listening behavior.

<br/>

[Allegheny County Tax Map](https://scottonestak.github.io/Projects/Allegheny_Tax_Map/Allegheny_Tax_Map.html)

Using the current local and property tax rates for Allegheny County municipalities as well as the current Common Level Ratio, I visualize how the municipalities collect tax revenue as well as build a tool to help visualize the total local + property annual tax given a person's income and estimated home purchase price.  I hope this can help individuals make more informed home purchasing decision in the Pittsburgh area.

<br/>

[Pittsburgh Neighborhood Zillow Tracker](https://scottonestak.github.io/Projects/Pittsburgh_Zillow_Tracker/Pittsburgh_Zillow_Tracker.html)

Scraping Zillow's data for sold houses, I used this information to examine patterns as well as construct a gradient boosting machine that can be used to predict a house's current sales value as well as view the effects of the most important features in the model.  Some of these most important variables include suburb, living area, and bathrooms.

<br/>

[2018 House Forecast](https://scottonestak.github.io/Projects/2018_House_Forecast/2018_House_Forecast.html)

Build a forecasting model to predict the results of the 2018 Midterm Election for the United States House of Representatives using variables such as demographics from the ACS, polling, financials, and previous election results.

<br/>

[Analyzing the 2016 Election](https://scottonestak.github.io/Projects/2016_Election/2016_Election_Analysis.html)

A deep dive into the results of the 2016 Election to analyze what were the driving factors for Trump's shocking win and Clinton's stunning defeat.
